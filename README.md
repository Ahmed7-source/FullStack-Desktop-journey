## Information about the Repository ⬇️
* Each volume contains my solutions and programming samples. This repository is constantly updated as I progress through the courses.
## Information about me ⬇️
* Name : Ahmed Alaa
* age  : 14
* My passion : I want to be a world-famous programmer and create programs that benefit all of humanity
* My programming certificates : [My Certifications Folder](./0.My%20programming%20certificates)
* Email : ahmed23156p@gmail.com <br>
* Whatsapp : [+971557178300](https://wa.me/971557178300)
## My projects ⬇️
* Project 1: (C++ Login Data Entry Program) The program is available in Arabic and English, and I will add other languages ​​as I progress. The project name suggests that the idea is to add your personal information, such as your name, surname, date of birth, gender, email address, password, phone number, and more. I will continue to develop and add more features to the program as I progress through the courses.
### The following courses are my road to learn how to make desktop applications
